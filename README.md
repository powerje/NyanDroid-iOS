NyanDroid iOS
=============

I was a bit bored so I created this monstrosity.

Welcome to the most inefficient thing ever.

NyanDroid uses OLImageView (https://github.com/ondalabs/OLImageView) to load animated GIFs into UIImageViews.

NyanDroid-iOS is based off of the NyanDroid live wallpaper for Android (https://github.com/powerje/NyanDroid)

Art for Nyan Droid itself created by Daniel Sandler.
